Python FP-Growth
================

This module provides a pure Python implementation of the FP-growth algorithm for
finding frequent itemsets. FP-growth exploits an (often-valid) assumption that
many transactions will have items in common to build a prefix tree. If the
assumption holds true, this tree produces a compact representation of the actual
transactions and is used to generate itemsets much faster than *Apriori* can.

Installation
------------

After downloading and extracting the package, install the module by running
`python setup.py install` from within the extracted package directory. (If you
encounter errors, you may need to run setup with elevated permissions:
`sudo python setup.py install`.)

Library Usage
-------------

Usage of the module is straightforward. Assuming you have some iterable of transactions (which are themselves iterables of items) called `transactions` and
an integer minimum support value `minsup`, you can find the frequent itemsets
in your transactions with the following code:

    from fp_growth import find_frequent_itemsets
    for itemset in find_frequent_itemsets(transactions, minsup):
        print itemset
        
Note that `find_frequent_itemsets` returns a generator of itemsets, not a
greedily-populated list. Each item must be hashable (i.e., it must be valid as
a member of a dictionary or a set).

Script Usage
------------

Once installed, the module can also be used as a stand-alone script. It will
read a list of transactions formatted as a CSV file. (An example of such a file
is included in the `examples` directory.)

    python -m fp_growth -s {minimum support} {path to CSV file}
    
For example, to find the itemsets with support ≥ 4 in the included example file:

    python -m fp_growth -s 4 examples/tsk.csv
